## ⚠️ Currently this repo is purely just to keep all code versioned, it is barely working and most things are not implemented.⚠️

# Concordia - Client
This is the official client for the usage of [Concordia - Server](https://github.com/StarlitEvelyn/Concordia-Server). The self-hostable, open sourced discord alternative!
